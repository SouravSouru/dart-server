Dart Backend with MySQL Example

This project demonstrates how to build a simple Dart backend using shelf for handling HTTP requests, shelf_router for routing, mysql1 for MySQL database integration, and args for command-line argument parsing.

Features
-> Command-Line Argument Parsing: Use the args package to handle command-line arguments.
-> HTTP Server with Routing: Built using the shelf and shelf_router packages to serve HTTP requests and manage routes.
-> MySQL Database Integration: Connect to a MySQL database using the mysql1 package to perform CRUD operations.
